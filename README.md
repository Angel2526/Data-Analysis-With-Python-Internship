# Data Analysis with Python 📊💻🔍 | Internship @ Main Flow Service and Technologies
## Introduction
   Data Analysis with Python involves using Python programming language and its libraries to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. This process includes cleaning the data, exploring its characteristics, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful insights to inform decision-making.
## Contents 
✔ TASK 1 : Understanding the basic datatypes in Python such as 

             🟀 lists
             
             🟀 dictionaries
             
             🟀 sets

✔ TASK 2 : Load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame(Data Manipulation) Perform operations like :

            🟀 filtering data based on conditions
            
            🟀 handling missing values
            
            🟀 calculating summary statistics.

✔ TASK 3 : Create a bar chart and a line chart using Matplotlib to visualize data from a Pandas DataFrame.(Data Visulaization):

            🟀  Visulaize data using Line plot,scatter plot,Bar plot and Histogram

            🟀  Customize the charts with labels, titles, and legends.

✔ TASK 4 : Create visualizations to understand (exploratory data analysis):
           
            🟀 distribution of variables
            
            🟀 identify outliers
            
            🟀 check for correlations between variables(pearson correlation coefficient)

✔ TASK 5 : Feature Engineering and Selection
            
            🟀 Generate meaningful features from existing data.
            
            🟀 Use techniques like PCA or feature importance to select the most important features.
            
            🟀 Optimize feature sets for improved model performance.

✔ TASK 6 : Advanced Data Analysis Techniques

            🟀 Implement time series analysis for forecasting trends and seasonality.

            🟀 Perform sentiment analysis or text mining on unstructured data.
            
            🟀 Explore clustering or classification techniques for segmentation and pattern recognition.
